<h2>Deadline</h2>
All ballots must be <strong>received</strong> by <strong>March 14, 2025, 23:59 PDT</strong>
<h2>How to Nominate (NomNom)</h2>
<p>
    You may nominate up to 5 persons or works in each category. You are permitted (and encouraged) to make fewer nominations or none at all if you are not familiar with the candidates in a category. The order in which you list your nominations has no effect on the outcome.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Enter your nominations in the text fields of the appropriate categories.</li>
    <li>
        Click ‘Save as you go’ to save your entries.
        <ul>
            <li>‘Save all’ at the bottom of the page performs the same function and will save a current version of the ballot.</li>
            <li>This form does not autosave!</li>
            <li>A green check mark shows next to each item when it saves.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Complete your nominations, and return to make as many changes as you want up until the deadline.</li>
    <li>Send yourself an email copy of your most recent saved ballot by selecting ‘Email my nominations to me’</li>
</ol>
<p>
    ”No Award” will appear automatically in every single category on the final ballot - there is no need to include that choice on the nomination form.
</p>
<p>When you save your ballot, you are acknowledging the name as listed in the nominations system.</p>
