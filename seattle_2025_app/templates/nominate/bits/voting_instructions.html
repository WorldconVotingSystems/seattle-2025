<h1>Deadline</h1>
<p>All Hugo Awards ballots must be received by <b>Wednesday, July 23, 2025, 11:59 p.m. PDT (UTC - 7)</b></p>

<h1>Voting on the E-Ballot</h1>
<p>As you scroll, complete the following for each category: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Select the rank you wish to give each finalist. </li>
<li>No Award is the final option on the ballot. </li>
<li>Select “Submit” or “Save as you go” to save your changes and submit your ballot.
<ol> 
    <li>The “Submit” Button is at the very bottom of the ballot</li>
    <li>“Save as you go” buttons are at the end of each category</li>
    <Li>Note: this form does not autosave. You will need to
    click the save buttons at the bottom of each section. The
    button will turn from light to dark blue, and the text will
    change from black to white, and remain that way until you
    click somewhere else on the page, indicating that your vote
    has been recorded. A copy of your ballot will be emailed to
    you after no activity on your ballot in 10 .</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h1>Notes on Voting</h1>
<ol>
<li>Unranked means that you are not ranking the finalist. </li>
<li>A lower preference is considered only if all the candidates ranked higher have been eliminated.</li>
<li>You are not required to rank all the finalists in any category. </li>
<li>If you decide not to vote in any given category, leave it “Unranked”.</li>
<li>”No Award” is not an abstention. It means that none of the finalists should be given the award in question. </li>
<li>If you give preference votes to finalists below your ranking of No Award, your vote will count for those finalists if all higher-ranked preferences, including No Award, are eliminated. </li>
<li>If you indicate a preference for No Award and leave other finalists blank, your vote will not count for or against those finalists at all. </li>
</ol>

<p>When the ballots are counted, all the first place votes will be tabulated. </p>

<p>If no finalist receives more than half of the votes, the finalist with the fewest first place votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the finalists with the next preferences on those ballots. </p>

<p>This process of elimination of the last-placed finalist and redistribution of their votes to the next available preference continues until one finalist has more than half of all remaining votes, at which point that finalist becomes the winner (except under specific conditions described in Section 3.6 and 3.12 of the <a href="https://www.wsfs.org/rules-of-the-world-science-fiction-society/">WSFS Constitution</a>).
You can make as many changes as you like to your ballot until the deadline. </p>
